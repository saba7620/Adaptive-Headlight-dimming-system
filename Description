Project Title: Li-Fi Powered Smart Headlight

Description:
This project implements a smart headlight system using Li-Fi communication and an Arduino board. 
The system dynamically detects light signals from oncoming vehicles and automatically adjusts the vehicle's headlight intensity to reduce glare and improve road safety at night.
The use of Li-Fi ensures fast, interference-free communication through visible light, eliminating the need for RF-based components.

Key Features:

Li-Fi based light signal detection

Automatic headlight dimming to prevent glare

Real-time responsiveness

Arduino-based integration for control logic

Cost-effective and energy-efficient solution
